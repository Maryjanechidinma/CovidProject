Project Title: COVID-19 Data Analysis
Project Description
This SQL project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data to gain insights into the pandemic's impact by exploring case numbers, deaths, population infection rates, and vaccination data across different locations. Using SQL, the project involves queries that aggregate, analyze, and compare COVID-19 metrics to produce insights into infection and mortality trends.

Project Objectives
Data Analysis: Use SQL to analyze COVID-19 case counts, death rates, and vaccination progress across various regions.
Trend Analysis: Identify trends in COVID-19 cases, mortality, and vaccination over time and by region.
Population Impact: Calculate infection rates relative to the population to assess COVID-19's impact.
Project Structure
SQL Script (CovidProject.sql): Contains SQL queries for creating tables, analyzing COVID-19 data, and generating reports on the pandemicâ€™s impact across locations.
Dataset
The dataset used includes the following tables:

covid_death: Contains data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and population by location and date.
vaccination_Info: Stores data on COVID-19 vaccination progress by location.
Key SQL Queries
This project includes various SQL queries organized as follows:

Data Retrieval: Basic SELECT statements to extract COVID-19 case and vaccination data.
Death Rate Analysis: Calculates the death rate as a percentage of total cases.
Population Impact: Computes the percentage of the population infected by COVID-19 per location.
Most Affected Regions: Identifies countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases relative to their population.
Prerequisites
Database: This SQL file is compatible with SQL Server (adjustments may be required for other SQL platforms).
Dataset: Ensure the tables covid_death and vaccination_Info are loaded with data as specified in the SQL file.
Usage
Setup: Load your dataset into your database.
Execution: Run CovidProject.sql in a SQL client.
Analysis: Interpret the output to understand the trends and impact of COVID-19 by country and population.
Results
Running these SQL queries will yield insights into:

Infection and mortality trends by location and over time.
Percentage of population affected in various regions.
Vaccination data to analyze the progress toward population immunity.
